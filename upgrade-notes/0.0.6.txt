The blueprint() function includes the Blueprint CSS framework. If you want to use it,
and you really should, include the following in your application <head>:

<php echo blueprint() ?>

Asset tags (styles and scripts for now) incude cachebusters:

<script type="text/javascript" href="scripts/application.js?1234567890"></script>

This means you can now set the Expires headers for static content to be
near-indefinite and still have users download the latest versions when an
update is made.
