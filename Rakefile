		For those who are using PHP to build their sites and want a very simple framework
		in which to organize their files, trivial is the solution. It's one PHP file
		that can include a few other pre-determined PHP and HTML files based on the
		request URI. This very simple division of content, actions (controllers), and
		views allows for multiple people to easily work on a smaller project without
		the overhead of a larger framework.
